    These slides form an overview of those themes and domains that best define my primary interests. However, I am keen to find new domains that can benefit from similar approaches, and new approaches the can benefit my existing domains of interest.

    In general:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Software-define metadata.
      \item In-network processing.
      \item Designing for polling-free/push-based operations.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Make Media Credible Again}

    \frametitle{Make Media Credible Again}
    \vspace{0mm}
    During the last decade or so, the credibility of online media has taken a dive. It has gotten so bad that there is no longer a shared sense of reality, and that has severe democratic implications.
    
    \vspace{3mm}
    We would like to create a system that allows us to track the premise graph of news:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Peer review based on user preferences rooted in a social network.
      \item Users will see credibility scores based on functions over their own set of trusted references. This makes the score subjective, and that subjectiveness should be observable through cluster and fragility analysis.
      \item Cycle detection to highlight that an "argument" is cyclic in nature and thus invalid.
      \item Subgraph invalidation when a premise is debunked.
      \item Subscription to invalidation. So that users get notified whenever a document that they have consumed is found invalid.
    \end{itemize}
