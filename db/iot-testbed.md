## Introduction

## Problem

How can one enable a number of users to upload code to and operate (provide input to/receive output from) IoT devices deployed under different circumstances?

- How should users be represented?
- How should users receive time on the instrumented devices?
- How can we provide artificial inputs (scenarios) to the devices (e.g., make sure that a pin goes high or that a "temperature" sensor provides some particular value)?
- How can we read the outputs of the device (LEDs and pins)?
- How can we provide an uplink?
- How can we provice a downlink?
- Which price-points are available to us, and how do they map to functionality?
