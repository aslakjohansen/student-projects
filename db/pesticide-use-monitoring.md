# Pesticide Use Monitoring

**Tags:** NDVI, satellite data, multi-spectral imagery, 

## Introduction

In collaboration with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (da: Milj√∏styrelsen).

Multispectral data from satellites can be used to detect to calculate the photosynthetic activity (aka \quoted{greeness}) of areas. When combined with GIS data defining the geographical areas of farmers plots, such plots can be mapped to greenness. Each pass these satellites generate a snapshot of that mapping at a single point in time. The history of passing shows how it evolves over time.

## Problem

Pesticides from the agricultural sector are finding their way into the ground water. While there are regulations in place to govern when and how much can be sprayed, the reality is that a only a small number of annual inspections are mandated. As a result, chances of getting caught are slim.

## Approach

By analyzing this evolution we can detect which plots have likely been exposed to excessive amounts of pesticides, and use this to guide the inspectors to the most likely violations. That will make the act of polluting our groundwater more risky.
