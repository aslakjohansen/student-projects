# Clicker System

**Tags:** web, concurrency, live, visualization, elixir, learning

## Introduction

The term *clicker* is slang for a [Classroom Response System](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/clickers/). 

## Problem

How can we design a clicker system, that allow us to define surveys programatically, and compare across invocation? For instance, if I do a survey before and after class, I would like to imediately compare the two.

Also, can this be gamified, so that users can (pseudo?)anonymously compare themselves to the cohort of the class? Or perhaps another class from a competing university?

Which other innovative *features* could be implemented if we don't need a human interface?

## Approach

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) with [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4mSbCoBTPI) would be natural choices for the job.
