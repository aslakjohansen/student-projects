# Modeling of On-Demand Virtual Sensors

**Tags:** virtual sensor, ontologies, virtual representation, digital twin, brick, 

## Introduction



## Problem

How should we represent virtual sensors in a Brick model?

In particular, this representation should allow for:
1. Seamless querying across physical and virtual sensors.
2. On-demand instantiation of virtual sensors.
