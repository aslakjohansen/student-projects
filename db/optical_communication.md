# Optical Communication

**Tags:** user-space driver, tcp, graphics

## Introduction

**Note:** This is kindof a toy project. I haven't found a generally relevant practical application. In areas where you are not allowed to put up wireless connections and you don't have an ethernet cable it would provide some value.

## Problem

How efficient can we make communication using a screen as transmitter and a webcamera as a receiver?

## Approach

Keep tracking screen so that the system is robust to a changing physical setup (e.g., laptops moving around).

Parameters to control:
- Rate of change
- "Pixel" size
- Number of colors
