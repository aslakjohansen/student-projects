# State-Scale Pubsub Substrate with Consistent Minimal Latency for Geographical Proximity

**Tags:** Publish Subscribe, Latency, 

## Introduction

## Problem

## Approach

A distributed publish-subscribe substrate where subscriptions are made based on distance (e.g., ping time, geographical distance, or some topological distance).

It should, basically, support queries like "I want to subscribe to state changes in those around me".

**Note:** A modern low(ish)-level language like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) or [Julia](https://julialang.org) should be used for the implementation.
