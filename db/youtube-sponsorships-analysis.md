## Introduction

Sponsorships has become a big part of the funding model of many prominent youtubers. While youtubers are quick to distance themselves when a sponsor is outed for predatory practices, they seem less interested in spending resources on doing their due diligence. Furthermore, when a sponsor has been determined to be a bad actor little is done by the youtubers to promote the realization that this is the case. Followers of the channel may never realize that they are being scammed.

Many of the problematic sponsors rely on an army of popular youtubers to push their products. If a large number of youtubers are suddenly regurgitating the same talking points about a certain product, then that is a sign of an ad campaign that could be an attempt to create a bubble of reassurance in the validity of the product: "Everybody is saying nice things about it, so it must be correct". That perception may not have any root in reality.

## Problem

How can we differentiate between sponsored product which provide real value and sponsored products whose exposure and apparent popularity is entirely paid for through the sponsor?

Intuition tells us that this will be a strong indicator for whether it should be avoided.

## Approach

Harvest sponsorship data from popular youtube channels. Come up with a metric for how gradual the introduction of a sponsorship is. Tag sponsorship according to target audience, product type, criticality (what info do they collect, which kind of responsibility do they get) and similar. Based on this, estimate a risk factor. Based on risk factor, determine which products should be examined.
