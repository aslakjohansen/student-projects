# Cost of Everything

## Introduction

As a species we are currently consuming resources at a rate that is higher than the planet can sustainably support. Likevise, the rate at which we are emitting greenhouse gasses are pushing the planet towards an ecosystem collaple of old testament proportions. The current per-capita ecological footprint of Denmark a four times what is sustainable [1]. That means, that if everybody lived as we do, we would need four planet earths to support the global population.

Few people seem to care enough to change their habits. It is too *grand* a problem, the utter collapse is too far away, and there is basically no transparancy mapping actions to impact.

## Problem

This project aims to explore what would be needed in terms of data structure, management, algorithms and resource consumption to construct a global model of each and every product/component. The goal would be to see (and document) to combined ecological footprint (in terms of energy, co2, clean water, conlict minerals ...) of the entire construction process of a product. A laptop, for instance, consists of many components (screen keys, PCB, electrical components, rubber feet), and each of these may consist of smaller components or materials and have a production and transportation story behind them.
