# Framework for Latency Experimentation

**Tags:** framework, performance evaluation, latency, experimentation

## Introduction

## Problem

How can we construct a framework for experimenting with latency-intolerant distributed systems that are spread across long distances?

Specifically,
- How can we (artificially) control the perceived distance (i.e., the round-trip time) without adding hundreds or thousands of km of network cables?
- How precise is such a system?
- What are our options for dealing with any such lack of precision?
