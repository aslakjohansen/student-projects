## Introduction

There are a number of problems that are intractable until environmental data have been made available. Areas that could be of interest:
- Determine how soil humidity in a field changes over time.
- Pinpointing the source of pollution in lakes.
- Construct indicators for indoor comfort.
- Measure vibrations in order to performance frequency analysis and determine early signs of failure.

Common to these areas, is a need to collect data. That includes
- Sampling some sensor.
- Pushing these data to some location in the cloud.
- Storing the data along with relevant metadata.

Problems of interest:
- Perform the on-device operations in accordance with the frequency of the observed phenomena, the latency requirements, and the energy envelope.
- Multihop routing (over a mesh) to cover longer distances.

## Problem

Pick a specific problem within the above domain.

## Approach

Produce a sensing device, and the relevant infrastructure.
