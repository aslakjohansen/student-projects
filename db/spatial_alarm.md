# Spatial Alarm

**Tags:** lat-long positioning

## Introduction

A normal alarm clock rings the moment a specific point in time has been reached. A spatial alarm rings the moment a specific point in space has been reached. When commuting it is important to be able to zone out, and not worry: *When is my next stop up?* A spatial alarm would allow a commuter to set an alarm for when some location is within some chosen distance. When alerted the commuter would wake up and transfer to the next mode of transport. Integration with travel planning services would make the user experience smooth.

## Problem

How can such an alarm app be implemented on a smartphone?
- What should the configuration interface look like?
- How should the notification be done to limit disturbances to passengers?
  - Could this be done by providing gradual hints (e.g., humming)?
